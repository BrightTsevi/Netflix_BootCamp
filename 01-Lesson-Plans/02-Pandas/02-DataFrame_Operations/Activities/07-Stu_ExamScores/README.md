# Exam Scores

In this activity, you will use the `melt()` function to melt a DataFrame and organize students' exam score data. 


## Instructions

1. Read the `exam_scores.csv` file into a DataFrame.

2. Once you have read the file into a DataFrame, create a bar chart to show how the data looks before we melt.

3. Melt the DataFrame into an organized form using the `melt()` function.

4. After melting the DataFrame, add a `var_name` and `value_name` that helps describe the data in the columns.

5. Create another bar chart to show how the data has changed after melting it.

6. **Bonus**: Convert your DataFrame from long form back to wide form using the `pivot_table()` function.
