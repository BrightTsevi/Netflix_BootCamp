# Car Purchases

In this activity, you will group different types of car data. Grouping a subset of data within a DataFrame is incredibly useful for organizing, summarizing, and performing analysis on a given dataset. 

## Data Source

* Car Purchases: https://data.world/nhtsa/cars-purchased-vehicles-xls

## Instructions

1. Start by reading the `new-vehicles.csv` file into a DataFrame.

2. Next, group by the following fields. For each of these, display the groups.

   * `New_Vehicle_Category`

   * `New_Vehicle_Make`

   * `New_Vehicle_Model`

   * `New_Vehicle_Year`

3. **Bonus**: Return the sum of vehicles per year and plot the results using a line.

   * If needed, refer to the following documentation: [Plotting in Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html)

   * We will cover plotting more in the coming weeks.
