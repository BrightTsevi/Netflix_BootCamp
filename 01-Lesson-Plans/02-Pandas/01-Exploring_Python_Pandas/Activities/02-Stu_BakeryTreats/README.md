# Bakery Treats

In this activity, you will create a DataFrame using three lists of different bakery treats.

## Instructions:

1. Start by creating a new DataFrame.

2. Add the following lists to the DataFrame.

    * `donuts`
    * `muffins`
    * `breads`

3. Print your results.

4. Create a dictionary using the `donuts`, `muffins`, and `breads` lists.

5. Create a new DataFrame from the dictionary.

6. **Bonus**: Import the `bakerytreats.csv` file into a DataFrame using the method you learned in Unit 1. In the next activity, we will look at a way to easily do this.
