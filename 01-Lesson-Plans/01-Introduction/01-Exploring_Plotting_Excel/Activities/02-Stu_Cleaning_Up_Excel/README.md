# Cleaning Up Excel

Often times in industry, we will receive tabular data in Excel that is incomplete, difficult to interpret or just unusable in its current state. For this activity we are going to practice applying Excel functions and tools to an order form from a imaginary grocery delivery service. This order form contains some useful information, but our expertise can make this data **far** more informative.

## Instructions

1. Create a new column in the Excel spreadsheet that converts the `Order Total (CAD)` from the Canadian Dollar (CAD) to the United States Dollar (USD). 
    
    * For this activity we will assume that $1 Canadian Dollars is equal to $.77 US Dollars.

2. Create another new column that determines if an order contains fresh produce in the `Products Ordered` column.

3. Create another new column that calculates the estimated delivery date from the `Order Date` column. 

    * If an order contains fresh produce, the estimated delivery date should be **3 days** after the order date, otherwise the estimated delivery date should be **14 days** after the order date.

4. Split the `Products Ordered` column into separate columns using the **^** delimiter. Add the split columns to the end of the Excel sheet.

5. Add conditional formatting to the Excel sheet to highlight if a order contains fresh produce. 

## Bonus (Optional)

For those who want an additional challenge or complete the activity early, try to complete these additional instructions.

6. Add custom conditional formatting to color-code each type of product ordered within an order.

7. Add a filter to the Excel sheet to only show orders that cost more than $50 US Dollars.
