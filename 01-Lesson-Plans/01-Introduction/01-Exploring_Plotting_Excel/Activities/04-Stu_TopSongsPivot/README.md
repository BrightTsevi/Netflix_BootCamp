# Top Songs Pivot Table

When dealing with large-scale datasets, you can use pivot tables to find commonalities amongst similar data points. 
In this activity, you will be provided a 5000 row spreadsheet containing data on the top 5000 songs from 1901 to 2015. You will use pivot tables to uncover which artists have the most songs in the top 5000, what they are, and which year they were released.

## Instructions

1. Select all of the data within your worksheet and create a new pivot table.

2. Make a pivot table with the follow criteria: 
   
   * Contains two rows: artist and name.
   
   * Can be filtered by year.

   * All of an artist's songs should be listed underneath their name.

3. Update your pivot table to contain values for:

   * How many songs an artist has in the top 5000.

   * The sum of the final_score of their songs.

4. Sort your pivot table by descending sum of the final_score.

## Bonus

5. Add three additional summary columns for the average raw_usa, average raw_eng and average raw_eur.

6. Find the artist with the overall highest sum of final_score, copy the entire section of the artist and their songs from the pivot table to a new sheet. 

7. Determine the song with the top average raw_usa, average raw_eng and average raw_eur scores. Highlight the row(s) that contain the top songs.
