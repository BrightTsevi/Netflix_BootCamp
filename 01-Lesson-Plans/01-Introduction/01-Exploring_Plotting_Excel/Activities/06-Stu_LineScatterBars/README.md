# Lines, Scatter and Bars, Oh My!

Now it's time to practice building basic visualizations in Excel. In this activity, you will be provided with three scenarios and datasets. For each scenario, you will decide if a line, bar or scatter plot with a trendline is most appropriate for visualizing the data. Then, you will use Excel to create each visualizations.  


## Instructions

1. Select the first sheet within the [activity workbook](Unsolved/LineScatterBars_Unsolved.xlsx) titled Video Game Sales. This dataset contains the average unit sales and review scores for a wide variety of video game titles.

   * For this dataset, create a plot that compares the Global_Sales column against the NA_Sales column.

   * **Hint:** Which plot is best for comparing two variables?

2. Next, select the second sheet in the activity workbook titled Student Grades Over Semester. This dataset contains a list of students' GPA scores over the course of six months.

   * For this dataset, create a plot that visualizes a single student's GPA across all 6 months.

   * **Hint:** Which plot best visualizes the changes of a single variable over time?

3. Lastly, select the third sheet in the activity workbook titled Pidgeon Racing. This dataset contains race results from a pigeon race by the American Racing Pigeon Union. 

   * For this dataset, first create a pivot table that looks across all breeders and counts up the sum of all entries per breeder.

   * Using this pivot table, create a plot that visualizes the sum of entries per breeder.

   * **Hint:** Which plot best visualizes measurements across categorical or named values?

## Bonus (Optional)

4. Return to the second sheet in the workbook, Student Grades Over Semester. Create a new plot that visualizes multiple student GPA scores over the course of six months.

5. Using the Pigeon Racing dataset, create a new pivot table that calculates the average speed of the pigeons by sex. Create a plot that best visualizes the comparison between average speed and sex of the pigeon.
